SocraGraph — A GNN + NLP Ideation Assistant

**SocraGraph** is an intelligent ideation assistant that combines  
**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, **Design Thinking**, and **Socratic Questioning**  
to nudge users toward deeper creative reasoning during the idea generation phase.

Instead of just *suggesting ideas*, SocraGraph *facilitates thinking* —  
it asks structured, Socratic-style questions, draws connections between concepts using a knowledge graph,  
and guides users through the iterative stages of **Design Thinking**.
